            <h2>The 10 Usability Heuristics</h2><br>
              <p>
                 The 10 principles known as Nielsen's heuristics were created
                 by computer scientist Jakob Nielsen in 1990 for analyzing the
                 usability of website interfaces. Nielsen&#180;s Heuristics are the
                 principles one should keep in mind while designing the layouts.

                 solve the right problems. A wonderful interface to
                 the wrong features will fail.&#8221;  ~ Jakob Nielsen</i>

             Error prevention is the 5th Usability Heuristic, which recommends that instead of well-designed 
             error messages, error prevention is preferable. It suggested to avoid any circumstance 
             or error that could influence a user's choice<br> to make an undesirable or incorrect choice.<br> 
             <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by Don Norman covers a great detail regarding the two categories
             of error, called <br>Slips  & Mistakes.

             <p><b> Slips</b><br>
             This kind of error happens when a user is aware of the objective or<br> the action they are going to do.
             However unintentionally, they fail.<br>Slips can be avoided, if the users get the options or a guide to input type.
             </p>
             <p><b>Mistakes</b><br> 
             Errors are the kind of mistakes that are typically made by people who have incomplete knowledge of the task 
             or any activity and a flawed detailed plan.
            </p>

                <h3>Recycle Bin in Microsoft</h3>
                <p> 
                When a user deletes a file intentionally or accidentally, the file moves to the Recycle Bin.
                The file can be restored from Recycle Bin, if it was deleted by accident. The files are stored
                there unless the user opens the Recycle Bin and deletes them. If the user opens Recycle Bin and tries 
                to delete the file, Microsoft confirms if the user wants to delete the file permenently. It is very important 
                to confirm from the user if he wants to proceed the process of deleting, making payments, buying the item etc.
                This is to prevent any mistake from happening in case user deletes any item by mistake.

                <h3>Creating an account for Walmart</h3> 
        
                <p> 
                While registering for Walmart, some information is asked from the user like
                First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Email address and Password. The user is not on his own here. 
                There is a proper guide to fill the information to prevent input errors. This is to prevent any slip errors where user might feel lost.
                For example, there is a proper guide to create a Password, which tells the user what the password should have:
                <li>Minimum of 8 characters </li> 
                <li>8-100 characters </li>  
                <li>Upper and lower case (to make password case sensitive)</li> 
                <li>Have atleast one number or a special character</li> 
                </p>
